Project Pasta
=====

("pasta" translated to Romanian is
["paste"](http://thetudor.ddns.net/pub/pasta.wav))

This is going to be a pastebin service written in pure Go. It will be written
using the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework/library.

Features
--------

* Paste administration. Each paste has a unique UUID that can be used to
	modify or delete it.
* Invite code support.
* Middleware support
	* Syntax highlighting
	* Online form
* [Mimetype support](https://golang.org/pkg/mime/)
* Charset support (UTF-8 by default)

To be continued (it's 00:14 dammit).
